# Atto!

this is atto, a new code editor similar to nano that came to existance with alot of AI and ALOT of Bullsh** but here we are, it uses crossterm and tui libraries


## Bugs I am aware of:

tab not working properly, maybe because it's just moving the cursor instead of actually inserting 4 spaces, need to fix


### Deps: 
  - rust

### Notes:

currently its in very early stages, this is version 0.0.2 so be sure to know that there is bugs 
bugs: cant write to an empty file the file needs to have stuff in it and you need a file to use atto

### Binds:

`CTRL + Q` -> exit
`CTRL + HJKL` -> move cursor
`CTRL + W` -> save file
`CTRL + R` -> reload file

### Next steps:

People want to see stuff like modes and a command so, we may do that but for now atto is fully usable and for now enjoy it as a simple nano like!

### Install:

let me figure that out for every distro and os
