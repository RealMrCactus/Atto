### Deps: 
  - rust

### Notes:

currently its in very early stages, this is version 0.0.2 so be sure to know that there is bugs 
bugs: cant write to an empty file the file needs to have stuff in it and you need a file to use atto

### Binds:

`CTRL + Q` -> exit

`CTRL + HJKL` -> move cursor

So after some people used it, here is a list of a few things that people seemingly want to see:
