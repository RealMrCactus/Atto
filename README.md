# Atto!

this is atto, a new code editor similar to nano that came to existance with alot of AI and ALOT of Bullsh** but here we 
the buffer works fine no mouse movements are detected in buffer
you use WASD to move the cursor around
there is no way to open a file with atto at the moment as it cant read from files
it cant write to files either

### next steps

- add file reading and writing
- possibly add some customisation
- potentionally use ICED to make it to a GUI under a similar name

feel free to fork or contribute to this project, i need help :]
